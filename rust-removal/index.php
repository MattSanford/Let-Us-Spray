				<h2 class="bg-header rust">The Culprits:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Common Rust</b> is a surface problem, usually no more than 1/16th of an inch in penetration and is prevalent on surfaces that are exposed to a large amount of oxidation being produced by metal. For instance, BBQs, patio furniture, handrails, wrought iron sculptures, AC drip pan overflows, etc.</li>
					<li><b>Orange battery acid</b> staining is an orange-colored flash acid burn which mimics rust in appearance, but is actually a completely different type of stain. Most commonly found where batteries are being charged, these stains build up over time and can penetrate concrete as deep as two inches.</li>
					<li><b>Irrigation staining</b> is caused by iron in the water being sprayed onto driveways, sidewalks, house siding, decorative stone, and ornaments.</li>
					<li><b>Fertilizer staining</b> is another major type of oxidation which causes rust stains to form on concrete and asphalt surfaces. It is more difficult to remove than common rust stains due to the nature of the fertilizer compounds causing the stains.</li>
					<li><b>Red clay staining</b> is impossible to remove with traditional pressure washing. It is caused by the heavy iron content of the red clay which is splashed onto the foundation and siding when water hits the exposed clay.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div class="accordion">
				<h2 class="bg-header rust">The Problem:</h2>
				<p>Traditional pressure/power washing will not remove these stains and high pressure will erode ANY surface! Most professional rust removal products currently on the market contain acids that “eat” the concrete! They strip the concrete of its protective cement paste and create an etched surface surrounding the orange acid burn. When these products eat the paste off, they only remove a minimal part of the stain; however, they cause deep, permanent damage to your concrete. Almost all other products formulated to remove rust will discolor the concrete, turn it white, or in some instances, turn it “more” orange. As you can see, this is not worth the risk because you may have a problem which has become two or three fold AND the concrete surface has sustained permanent damage.</p>

						<h2 id="century21">SoftWashing - 21<sup>st</sup> Century <em>Technology</em></h2>
						<p>Soft-washing is a cleaning process which utilizes ultra low pressure to deliver a customized cleaning solution, specially blended to meet the demands of each project. It differs from pressure washing in that the cleaning solution is applied and rinsed at extremely low pressure which will not harm or damage painted surfaces, vinyl siding, wood, nor contribute to granular loss of composite roof shingles.</p>
						<p>The power of chemistry is what makes our Soft-wash process so effective. Different surfaces and different contaminants require different levels of "soft washing". With each cleaning job we perform, our cleaning solution is custom mixed on site and applied. We do not have a "one size fits all" approach to cleaning. We will customize a cleaning plan to maximize effectiveness while also keeping your cost as low as possible!</p>

						<h2 id="technology">The Unique Soft Wash System</h2>
						<p>Dark stains on your roof are caused primarily by a persistent type of algae, Gloeocapsa Magma. The SoftWash System gently removes the staining without harming the roof itself.  AND it kills the algae and other harmful organisms so the stains don't come back!</p>
						<ol>
							<li>The microorganisms that cause roof staining actually have tiny root systems which physically break down asphalt and composite roof shingles, allowing larger types of organisms to grow on your roof. The SoftWash System kills these roots and applies an algaecide and fungicide to protect against future attacks.</li>
							<li>SoftWash uses sodium hypochlorite (bleach), which is necessary to kill harmful algae, bacteria, mold, and fungus with nearly 100% efficiency.</li>
							<li>During use and disposal, 95% to 98% of bleach rapidly breaks down into salt and water, so there's no need to worry about environmental harm. The remaining byproducts are effectively treated by municipal wastewater and septic systems.</li>
							<li>Sodium hypochlorite is the same chemical used to treat our drinking water and sanitize and brighten our swimming pools. The notion that it will harm your roof is a scare tactic.</li>
							<li>SoftWash application is very fast and you'll see results immediately!</li>
							<li>Our cleaning solution is applied with an electric pump, which greatly minimizes noise and pollution.</li>
